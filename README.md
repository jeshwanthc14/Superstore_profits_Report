# Superstore Profit Dashboard Report

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard report analyzing the profits generated by Superstore across different cities and product categories. The dashboard provides insights into sales data to identify the most profitable regions and categories.

## What I've Done
I've created a Power BI dashboard report focusing on analyzing the profits of Superstore sales. Here's a breakdown of what I've done:

1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Initially, I extracted the sales data from Superstore's database. This included information such as sales amounts, profits, product categories, and city-wise sales.

2. **Data Transformation and Modeling**: I performed data transformation tasks to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involved handling missing values, filtering irrelevant data, and creating calculated columns for further analysis.

3. **Dashboard Creation**: Using Power BI, I designed a dashboard with interactive visualizations to showcase the profits generated by Superstore across different dimensions. This includes visualizations such as bar charts, maps, and tables to provide a comprehensive view of the sales performance.

4. **Insights Generation**: Based on the dashboard analysis, I derived insights into the top-performing cities, profitable product categories, and regions driving the most profits for Superstore.

5. **Documentation**: I've documented the process and insights gained from the dashboard analysis in this README file to provide a clear understanding of the report's objectives and findings.

## Screenshots
I've included screenshots of the dashboard in the "screenshots" folder to provide a visual representation of the report's findings.
